This JavaScript code implements a **simple console-based To-Do List application** where users can add, remove, and view tasks. Let’s break it down step by step.

---

## 1️⃣ **`let todos = [];`**
This line declares an **array named `todos`**, which will store all the tasks entered by the user.

---

## 2️⃣ **`function addTask()`**
This function allows the user to **add a task** to the list.

### **How It Works:**
- It **prompts** the user to enter a task.
- If the user enters a task (i.e., they don't leave it blank), it gets **added to the `todos` array** using `push(task)`.
- A message is printed in the console: `Added: "task"`
- If the user doesn’t enter anything, it prints: `No task entered.`
- Finally, the function calls `showTasks()` to display the updated task list.

---

## 3️⃣ **`function removeTask()`**
This function allows the user to **remove a task** from the list.

### **How It Works:**
- First, it calls `showTasks()` to display the existing tasks.
- Then, it prompts the user to enter the **task number** (not the index) to remove.
- Since arrays in JavaScript start from **index `0`**, we convert the user’s input into an **index** by subtracting `1`.
- If the user enters a valid number:
  - The corresponding task is removed using `splice(index, 1)`.
  - A message is printed in the console: `Removed: "task"`
- If the input is **invalid** (not a number, out of range, etc.), it prints: `Invalid task number.`
- Finally, it calls `showTasks()` to show the updated list.

---

## 4️⃣ **`function showTasks()`**
This function **displays the to-do list**.

### **How It Works:**
- It first prints `"Your To-Do List:"`.
- If there are **no tasks**, it prints `"No tasks yet."`
- Otherwise, it **loops** through the `todos` array using `forEach()` and prints each task with a number.

Example:
```js
1. Buy groceries
2. Do homework
3. Walk the dog
```
---

## 5️⃣ **`function showMenu()`**
This function **displays a menu** for the user to choose an action.

### **How It Works:**
- It repeatedly shows a **menu** with four options:
  1. Add a task
  2. Remove a task
  3. View tasks
  4. Exit
- It uses a `do...while` loop to **keep running until the user chooses option "4" (Exit)**.
- Based on the user's input, it **calls the appropriate function**:
  - `"1"` → Calls `addTask()`
  - `"2"` → Calls `removeTask()`
  - `"3"` → Calls `showTasks()`
  - `"4"` → Prints `"Exiting..."` and stops the loop.
  - **Any other input** → Prints `"Invalid choice."` and shows the menu again.

---

## 6️⃣ **`showMenu();`**
This line **starts** the program by calling the `showMenu()` function.

## **Example Run (How It Works in Practice)**
### **Scenario 1: Adding Tasks**
```
Choose an option:
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View Tasks
4. Exit
> 1
Enter a task: Buy groceries
Added: "Buy groceries"
Your To-Do List:
1. Buy groceries
```

### **Scenario 2: Adding More Tasks**
```
Choose an option:
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View Tasks
4. Exit
> 1
Enter a task: Walk the dog
Added: "Walk the dog"
Your To-Do List:
1. Buy groceries
2. Walk the dog
```

### **Scenario 3: Removing a Task**
```
Choose an option:
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View Tasks
4. Exit
> 2
Your To-Do List:
1. Buy groceries
2. Walk the dog
Enter the task number to remove: 1
Removed: "Buy groceries"
Your To-Do List:
1. Walk the dog
```

### **Scenario 4: Viewing Tasks**
```
Choose an option:
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View Tasks
4. Exit
> 3
Your To-Do List:
1. Walk the dog
```

### **Scenario 5: Exiting**
```
Choose an option:
1. Add Task
2. Remove Task
3. View Tasks
4. Exit
> 4
Exiting...
```

## 🔥 **Key JavaScript Concepts Used**
1. **Arrays (`todos.push()`, `todos.splice()`)** → To store and manage tasks.
2. **Loops (`forEach()`, `do...while`)** → To display tasks and keep showing the menu.
3. **Conditional Statements (`if...else`)** → To handle user inputs properly.
4. **`prompt()`** → To take input from the user.
5. **`console.log()`** → To show output on the console.

## 💡 **How Can You Improve This?**
- **Replace `prompt()` with HTML Inputs** to create a web-based UI.
- **Store tasks in `localStorage`** so they don’t disappear when you refresh the page.
- **Allow editing tasks** instead of just adding/removing them.
