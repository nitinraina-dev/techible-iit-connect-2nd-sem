# CSS Grid Examples - README

## Overview
This project demonstrates various CSS Grid properties and techniques through a structured HTML file. The examples cover fundamental grid concepts, including basic layouts, grid template areas, grid gaps, spanning rows and columns, auto-fill/auto-fit properties, implicit/explicit grids, grid alignment, and named grid lines.

## How to Use
1. Download or copy the `index.html` file.
2. Open the file in a web browser.
3. Observe different grid layouts and behaviors as explained in each section.

## Examples Included

### 1. Basic Grid Layout
- A simple grid with 3 columns and 2 rows.
- Uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`.

### 2. Grid Template Areas
- Defines a structured layout using named grid areas.
- Layout includes `header`, `sidebar`, `content`, and `footer`.

### 3. Grid Gap
- Demonstrates spacing between grid items using `grid-gap`.

### 4. Spanning Rows and Columns
- Uses `grid-column: span 2;` and `grid-row: span 2;` to merge cells.

### 5. Auto-Fill vs Auto-Fit
- `auto-fill` creates as many columns as possible while maintaining a minimum size.
- `auto-fit` adjusts column sizes dynamically to fit available space.

### 6. Implicit and Explicit Grid
- Displays behavior when grid items exceed defined rows/columns.

### 7. Grid Alignment
- Demonstrates `align-items` and `justify-items` properties for centering elements.

### 8. Named Grid Lines
- Assigns custom names to grid lines for easier positioning.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for layout and styling

## Customization
- Modify the CSS properties to experiment with different grid behaviors.
- Adjust the number of columns and rows in `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`.
